## **The Simulation is Inevitable. And it needs means of value.**

Humanity has introduced subliminal, social frameworks to offload the burden of survival — first through religion and money, and later through technology. The largest threat to survival in the modern world is social collapses. Since the computer and internet, our existence split increasingly into two domains: the physical and the digital.  Computers replaced work, but eventually sucked our attention. The internet connected us, but eventually controlled information. Crypto replaced capital, but has started reforming our incentive systems.

Crypto is the next step in humanity's techno journey beyond the physical world.  Capital becomes a boundless, programmable construct. Over time, the fusion of cryptocurrencies with other technologies like social platforms and brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) could drive a deep convergence between the digital and the physical.

This system cannot function without an incorruptible measure of value - one that is voluntary yet commands attention, resistant to coercion yet universally recognized. For this, only one asset works: **Bitcoin.**

Bitcoin can serve as the foundation of the simulation, an autonomous system for value and coordination that operates beyond the control of states and institutions. It is the backbone of a financial future that is open, sovereign, and inevitable. It has proven itself unstoppable across space and immutable across time—an unbreakable foundation for a new world.

## Bitcoin Protocol Design Considerations

If Bitcoin is to serve as the backbone of a purely digital world, its capabilities need to be expanded to support advanced use cases. Considerations include:

- **Expressivity** - Bitcoin’s scripting capabilities were designed to minimize the amount of attack vectors, but also prevented the development of advanced applications. Bitcoin’s L1 is becoming increasingly ossified, requiring creative approaches to build valuable applications.
- **Protocol Architecture Trade-Offs** - Bitcoin is designed to be the most decentralized and available-partitioned; not the most latency-efficient, consistent database. Application-specific protocols favoring latency minimization are required for load-intensive applications.
- **Security Budget and Block Size -** Satoshi's choice of 1Mb block size indicated a desire to ramp up the fees market by keeping block space scarce. A fee market around simple transfers has demonstrated to be not enough to compliment and effectively replace the miner subsidization, which means Bitcoin L1 transactions gotta be about something more than just transfers for people to be willing to pay more while keeping the block space scarce.
- **Security Budget** - Bitcoin was designed to provide subsidies to incentivize robust network security, but as block rewards halve every four years the network becomes increasingly reliant on transaction fees. Without increased functionality to boost fee revenue, the long-term sustainability of its security is at risk.
- **The Ossification Dilemma -** Bitcoin was designed to be largely resistant to change, proving itself over time to be secure and stable but also increasingly inflexible, making it harder to introduce new features or improvements. Soft forks are becoming less viable, underscoring the need for cryptographic solutions to expand functionality without compromising the core protocol.

## **Introducing [[alloc] init]**

**[[alloc] init] is a cryptography research and development organization committed to Bitcoin's evolution by bringing full expressivity without compromising security.** Our mission is to make Bitcoin more programmable, scalable, and expressive — opening new frontiers for developers, network operators, institutions, everyday users, and communities to innovate and thrive within the Bitcoin ecosystem. We aim to empower Bitcoin to serve as the substrate for the next generation of financial and social infrastructure, and adamantly believe that the vast majority of crypto activity will migrate and reside on Bitcoin as the world’s dominant blockchain.

## **Bitcoin PIPEs for Bringing Expressivity to Bitcoin L1**

**Our flagship contribution is Bitcoin PIPEs ([paper](https://www.allocin.it/uploads/placeholder-bitcoin.pdf)), an obfustopia-class cryptographic framework and toolchain that represents a promising shift in Bitcoin’s functional capabilities.** PIPEs introduce expressivity to Bitcoin by emulating missing Bitcoin opcodes (`OP_CAT`, `OP_CTV`, `OP_TXHASH`, et al), enabling covenant implementations without requiring changes to Bitcoin’s core protocol. PIPEs also introduces zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) to Bitcoin, opening the opportunity to enhance scalability, programmability, and privacy.

PIPEs enable use cases such as trustless vaults and bridges, zkRollups, staking, and fungible token standards, all without altering the core protocol.

This way, global adoption of Bitcoin as a store-of-value asset remains unchanged while it’s functional capabilities are expanded using off-chain, trust-minimized, cryptographic computing.

## Bitcoin. Simulation Money.

Bitcoin isn’t just the future of money or digital gold - it’s the foundation of a social shift towards purely digital existence. And for this, Bitcoin serves as endgame money enhanced with expressive, scalable applications and infrastructure built with PIPEs.
