## **The Simulation is Inevitable. And it will be Orange.**

Humanity has introduced subliminal, social frameworks to offload the burden of survival — first through religion and money, and later through technology. The largest threat to survival in the modern world is social collapses. Since the computer and internet, our existence split increasingly into two domains: the physical and the digital.  Computers replaced work, but eventually sucked our attention. The internet connected us, but eventually controlled information. Crypto replaced capital, but has started reforming our incentive systems.

Crypto is the next step in humanity's techno journey beyond the physical world. Capital becomes a boundless, programmable construct. Over time, the fusion of cryptocurrencies with other technologies like social platforms and brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) could drive a deep convergence between the digital and the physical.

Such a convergence though is more of a social nature than a technical one, which means human participation is essential. Participation cannot be forceful which means the system should provide incentives (economic benefits in comparison to purely physical or hybrid existence) and possess attention. Attention creates value (just like an asset cannot be valuable without possessing attention) and the largest purely digital store of value, the one that is voluntary yet commands attention, resistant to coercion yet universally recognized is **Bitcoin**.\
\
Bitcoin can serve as the foundation of the simulation, an autonomous system for value and coordination that operates beyond the control of states and institutions. It is the backbone of a financial future that is open, sovereign, and inevitable. It has proven itself unstoppable across space and immutable across time—an unbreakable foundation for a new world.

## **Bitcoin Protocol Design Considerations**

If Bitcoin is to serve as the backbone of a purely digital world, its capabilities need to be expanded to support advanced use cases. Considerations include:

* Expressivity - Bitcoin’s scripting capabilities were designed to minimize the amount of attack vectors, but also prevented the development of advanced applications. Bitcoin’s L1 is becoming increasingly ossified, requiring creative approaches to build valuable applications.
* Protocol Architecture Trade-Offs - Bitcoin is designed to be the most decentralized and available-partitioned; not the most latency-efficient, consistent database. Application-specific protocols favoring latency minimization are required for load-intensive applications.
* Security Budget and Block Size  - Satoshi's choice of 1Mb block size indicated a desire to ramp up the fees market by keeping block space scarce. A fee market around simple transfers has proven itself insufficient to mitigate the decline in block reward subsidies, which means Bitcoin L1 transactions need to expand in terms of complexity and value.
* The Ossification Dilemma - Bitcoin was designed to be largely resistant to change, proving itself to be secure and stable but also increasingly inflexible, making it harder to introduce new features or improvements. Soft forks are becoming less viable, underscoring the need for cryptographic solutions to expand functionality without compromising the core protocol.

## **Introducing \[\[alloc] init]**

**\[\[alloc] init] is a cryptography research and development organization committed to Bitcoin's evolution by bringing full expressivity without compromising security.**

Our mission is to make Bitcoin more programmable, scalable, and expressive — opening new frontiers for developers, network operators, institutions, everyday users, and communities to innovate and thrive within the Bitcoin ecosystem. We aim to empower Bitcoin to serve as the substrate for the next generation of financial and social infrastructure, and adamantly believe that the vast majority of crypto activity will migrate and reside on Bitcoin as the world’s dominant blockchain.

## **Bitcoin PIPEs for Bringing Expressivity to Bitcoin L1**

Our flagship contribution is Bitcoin PIPEs ([paper](https://www.allocin.it/uploads/placeholder-bitcoin.pdf)), an obfustopia-class cryptographic framework and toolchain that represents a promising shift in Bitcoin’s functional capabilities.

PIPEs introduce expressivity to Bitcoin by emulating missing Bitcoin opcodes (`OP_CAT`, `OP_CTV`, `OP_TXHASH`, et al), enabling covenant implementations without requiring changes to Bitcoin’s core protocol. PIPEs also introduces zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) to Bitcoin, opening the opportunity to enhance scalability, programmability, and privacy.

PIPEs enable use cases such as trustless vaults and bridges, zkRollups, staking, and fungible token standards, all without altering the core protocol.

This way, global adoption of Bitcoin as a store-of-value asset remains unchanged while it’s functional capabilities are expanded using off-chain, trust-minimized, cryptographic computing.

## **Bitcoin. Simulation Money.**

Bitcoin isn’t just the future of money or digital gold - it’s the foundation of a social shift towards purely digital existence. And for this, Bitcoin serves as endgame money enhanced with expressive, scalable applications and infrastructure built with PIPEs.
