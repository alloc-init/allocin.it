        title: ABOUT US
        text: >-
          [[alloc] init] is a cryptography research and development company
          committed to bringing full expressivity to Bitcoin — without requiring
          protocol changes, preserving Bitcoin's core principles. 


          Our mission is to make Bitcoin more programmable, scalable, and
          expressive—opening new frontiers for developers, operators,
          institutions, consumers, and communities to innovate and thrive. We
          aim to empower Bitcoin to serve as the substrate for the next
          generation of financial and social infrastructure, remaining immutable
          yet increasingly capable.

        title: TECHNOLOGY
        text: >-
          We are building Bitcoin PIPEs, an encryption scheme leveraging
          advanced cryptographic techniques to vastly expand Bitcoin's
          functionality without the need for soft forks or compromising
          security.




          PIPEs introduce expressivity to Bitcoin by emulating missing Bitcoin
          opcodes (OP_CAT, OP_CTV, OP_TXHASH, et al), enabling practical and
          performant covenant implementations without requiring changes to
          Bitcoin’s core protocol. PIPEs introduce zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs)
          to Bitcoin, providing a promising path for use cases demanding
          scalability, programmability, and privacy.

        text: >-
          Bitcoin is more than digital gold; it is the secure, immutable
          foundation for digital convergence and financial sovereignty —
          unifying value measurement and transfer with trust and autonomy.


          We envision a world where Bitcoin’s unparalleled security and role as
          endgame money are enhanced with expressive, scalable infrastructure
          and applications. To achieve our vision, we've built a research-driven
          team of top cryptographers, engineers, and founders. We welcome
          partners who share our vision and believe in Bitcoin's promise,
          principles, and the power of programmable cryptography.
