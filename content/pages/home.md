        title: ABOUT US
        text: |
          **\[\[alloc] init]** is a cryptography research and development company committed to bringing more expressivity to Bitcoin — without requiring protocol changes, preserving Bitcoin's core principles.

          Our mission is to make Bitcoin more programmable, scalable, and expressive—opening new frontiers for developers, operators, institutions, consumers, and communities to innovate and thrive. We aim to empower Bitcoin to serve as the substrate for the next generation of financial and social infrastructure, remaining immutable yet increasingly capable.

          Our major contribution is Bitcoin PIPEs (v1 and v2), a cryptographic primitive leveraging witness encryption constructions to expand Bitcoin's functionality without the need for soft forks or compromising security.

          PIPEs introduce expressivity to Bitcoin by emulating certain missing covenant opcodes, enabling practical and performant covenant implementations without requiring changes to Bitcoin’s core protocol. PIPEs introduce zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) to Bitcoin, providing a promising path for use cases demanding scalability, programmability, and privacy.

        title: VISION
        text: |
          We believe Bitcoin is simulation money, a foundation for digital convergence and financial sovereignty — unifying value measurement and transfer with trust and autonomy.

          We envision a world where Bitcoin’s unparalleled security and role as endgame money are enhanced with expressive, scalable infrastructure and applications. To achieve our vision, we've built a research-driven team of top cryptographers, engineers, and founders. We welcome partners who share our vision and believe in Bitcoin's promise, principles, and the power of programmable cryptography.
