        title: ABOUT US
        text: |
          **\[\[alloc] init]** is a cryptography research and development company committed to bringing more expressivity to Bitcoin — without requiring protocol changes, preserving Bitcoin's core principles.

          Our mission is to make Bitcoin more programmable, scalable, and expressive—opening new frontiers for developers, operators, institutions, consumers, and communities to innovate and thrive. We aim to empower Bitcoin to serve as the substrate for the next generation of financial and social infrastructure, remaining immutable yet increasingly capable.

          Our major contribution is Bitcoin PIPEs, a cryptographic primitive leveraging witness encryption constructions to expand Bitcoin's functionality without the need for soft forks or compromising security.

          PIPEs introduce expressivity to Bitcoin by emulating missing Bitcoin covenant opcodes (**OP\_VAULT**, **OP\_CSFS**, et al), enabling practical and performant covenant implementations without requiring changes to Bitcoin’s core protocol. PIPEs introduce zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) to Bitcoin, providing a promising path for use cases demanding scalability, programmability, and privacy.

        title: VISION
        text: |
          We believe Bitcoin is — and should always remain — a self-custodial monetary system in which trust and correctness are enforced strictly through consensus and cryptography. Each holder controls not only their funds, but the precise conditions under which those funds may be spent.

          We build cryptographic infrastructure that increases Bitcoin’s expressiveness and scalability while remaining fully compatible with existing consensus rules. Our goal is to enable more powerful spending conditions and applications without introducing intermediaries, trusted operators, or protocol changes.
